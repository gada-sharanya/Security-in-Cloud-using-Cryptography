Blowfish and AES are both symmetric encryption algorithms meaning both encryption and  decryption keys are the same. This also means that the same key is shared to enable secure  communication.
This type of encryption is typically used for bulk data encryption. It also can be easily  implemented by hardware. The main issue with symmetric encryption is that a person with the  decryption key can decrypt all of the data.
Blowfish works fast due to its bulk encryption and decryption. Blowfish uses a block size of 64  bits. It is even faster than AES implemented in software, but still, it is not as effective as AES.
